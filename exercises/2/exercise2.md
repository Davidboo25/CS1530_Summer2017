## Stakeholder Interaction Exercise

In this exercise, you will get two points for asking me a question about the product.  Everybody must ask at least one valid question in order to get credit.

Everybody should be _listening_ to the questions and be ready to turn the questions into user stories for your sprint deliverable 1.
